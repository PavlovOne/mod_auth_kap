If your platform is not supported or you want to run the latest code,
you can build from source as described below.

Installation from source
========================

You will require development headers and tools for the following
dependencies:
 Apache (>=2.0)
 OpenSSL (>=0.9.8) (>=1.0 for Elliptic Curve support)
 Curl (>=?)
 Jansson (>=2.0) (JSON parser for C)
 pcre3 (>=?) (Regular Expressions support)
 pkg-config

and if you want Redis support:
 hiredis (>=0.9.0) (Redis client for C)


Configure, make and install with:

(run ./autogen.sh first if you work straight from the github source tree)
./configure --with-apxs2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs2
make
make install

Note that, depending on your distribution,  apxs2 may be named apxs.

Configuration
=============

Edit the configuration file for your web server. Depending on
your distribution, it may be named '/etc/apache/httpd.conf' or something
different.

You need to add a LoadModule directive for mod_auth_kap. This will
look similar to this:

LoadModule auth_kap_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_auth_kap.so

To find the full path to mod_auth_kap.so, you may run:

apxs2 -q LIBEXECDIR

This will print the path where Apache stores modules. mod_auth_kap.so
will be stored in that directory.

After you have added the LoadModule directive, you must add the configuration
for mod_auth_kap. For a quickstart doing so, see the provided samples
in the README.md file.

For an exhaustive overview of all configuration primitives, see: auth_kap.conf
